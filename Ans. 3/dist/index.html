    <p class="w-8/12 text-sm text-slate-700"><span class="font-bold text-2xl text-slate-950">His saga is the entrepreneurial creation myth</span> writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded
        Apple in his parents' garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in
        1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the world's most valuable company.
        Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music,
        phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of
        America's great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was
        a saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied
        imagination to technology and business.</p>
